## Compatibility

- Ensure that the gem is compatible with the version of Ruby and Rails you are using. Check the gem documentation or the project's GitHub repository for information on supported versions.

## Dependencies

- The gem relies on the WKHTMLTOPDF command-line tool, so make sure you have it installed on your system and accessible in the PATH.

## Known Issues

- Like any software, the "wkhtmltopdf_for_rails" gem may have some known issues. Check the project's GitHub repository or issue tracker for any reported bugs or limitations.

## Potential Challenges

- Generating PDFs can be resource-intensive, especially for complex or large documents. Keep in mind that generating PDFs may require more memory and processing power compared to rendering HTML views.

- The layout and styling of your HTML views may not always translate perfectly to the PDF output. It's important to thoroughly test and preview the generated PDFs to ensure they meet your requirements.

# Troubleshooting

## Common Issues

1. **WKHTMLTOPDF executable not found**: One common issue is that the WKHTMLTOPDF executable is not found. This can happen if the executable path is not correctly configured or if the WKHTMLTOPDF tool is not installed on the system. To resolve this issue, make sure that the WKHTMLTOPDF tool is installed and the correct path to the executable is specified in the gem configuration.

2. **PDF generation fails**: If the PDF generation fails, it could be due to various reasons such as invalid HTML markup, missing assets (CSS, images, etc.), or incompatible options. To troubleshoot this issue, start by checking the HTML markup for any errors or missing elements. Ensure that all required assets are properly referenced and accessible. Additionally, review the options used for PDF generation and ensure they are compatible with the WKHTMLTOPDF version being used.

3. **Fonts not rendering correctly**: Fonts may not render correctly in the generated PDF if the required font files are not accessible or if the font configuration is not set up correctly. To resolve this issue, ensure that the font files are available and properly referenced in the CSS. You may need to configure the font options in the gem to specify the correct font paths or use the `--user-style-sheet` option to include a CSS file with font definitions.

## Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Check gem version compatibility**: Ensure that the version of the `wkhtmltopdf_for_rails` gem you are using is compatible with the version of WKHTMLTOPDF installed on your system. Incompatibilities between gem and tool versions can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

2. **Review gem configuration**: Double-check the gem configuration to ensure that all necessary options are set correctly. Pay attention to the executable path, font options, and any other relevant settings.

3. **Test with minimal HTML content**: If you are experiencing issues with PDF generation, try testing with a minimal HTML content to isolate the problem. Gradually add complexity to the HTML and test after each change to identify the specific cause of the issue.

4. **Check system dependencies**: Ensure that all required system dependencies for WKHTMLTOPDF are installed on your system. This includes libraries such as libfontconfig, libXrender, and libXext. Refer to the WKHTMLTOPDF documentation for the specific dependencies required for your operating system.

5. **Consult the documentation and community**: If you are unable to resolve the issue, consult the documentation for the `wkhtmltopdf_for_rails` gem and the WKHTMLTOPDF tool. Additionally, seek help from the community by posting your issue on relevant forums or discussion boards.

Remember to provide detailed information about the issue, including any error messages, relevant code snippets, and steps to reproduce the problem when seeking help or reporting a bug.
